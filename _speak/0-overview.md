#### What do you do if your friend gets bullied… or is a bully themselves?

#### ‘The little moments matter’: S’porean, 26, helps at-risk youths through mentorship & sports  
Inspired by his time working at the Singapore Boys’ Hostel, Joshua Tay wanted to be there for these youths after they left the hostel. Together with his friends, he founded Impart, a non-profit organisation that helps at-risk youth reintegrate into society. If you have an idea to start something like Joshua, tap on the Our Singapore Fund to make your ground-up initiative come alive!
