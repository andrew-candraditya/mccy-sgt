#### Reading Food Labels - Making Sense of the Fine Print   

At the supermarket, we may grab a few cans of food, but how many of us look beyond the brand and name of the product? There’s a wealth of information printed on the label. Reading it could help us make better decisions for our health, and maybe even our wallets.

#### Passion for Business: Singaporeans Share Their Entrepreneurship Journeys 

If you have the security of working for an established organisation, as well as a regular salary, striking out on your own is not easy. You’ll face long hours, limited manpower, extensive multi-tasking … but for some, a belief in themselves spurs them on. They share their stories.

#### The Adaptable Caregiver 

Being a caregiver to someone with an addiction can be very difficult. In fact, in trying their best to help, they feel ineffective, frustrated, and burnt-out. With a strong support network, and a lot of self-care, one man overcame his situation.

#### ‘The little moments matter’: S’porean, 26, helps at-risk youths through mentorship & sports  
Inspired by his time working at the Singapore Boys’ Hostel, Joshua Tay wanted to be there for these youths after they left the hostel. Together with his friends, he founded Impart, a non-profit organisation that helps at-risk youth reintegrate into society. If you have an idea to start something like Joshua, tap on the Our Singapore Fund to make your ground-up initiative come alive!
