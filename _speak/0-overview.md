### Emerging Stronger Conversations

The COVID-19 crisis has brought about changes and challenges for our nation. At the same time, it is also an opportunity for us to reflect and learn from our experience. Join us for a series of conversations to share your hopes for a resilient, post-COVID Singapore society, and how we can work together to create a better future. 

There are upcoming conversations: The next session on **Tue, 24 Nov (7pm-9:30pm)** will focus on essential workers; a Tamil session will be held on **Sat, 28 Nov (3pm-5:30pm)**.

#### ‘The little moments matter’: S’porean, 26, helps at-risk youths through mentorship & sports  
Inspired by his time working at the Singapore Boys’ Hostel, Joshua Tay wanted to be there for these youths after they left the hostel. Together with his friends, he founded Impart, a non-profit organisation that helps at-risk youth reintegrate into society.
