### Dr Toh Tai Chong 
### Citizens’ Panel on Work-Life Harmony 

“We had a lot of autonomy in deciding what problems to address and what solutions to choose.” 
 
As part of the ‘sandwich generation’, I’m keen to share more about the challenges of being a caregiver for both young children and aging parents. I’m also interested to learn about different initiatives that can be implemented in my workplace. 
 
So, I signed up for the Citizens’ Panel on Work-Life Harmony when it appeared in the news. It has been an enlightening experience. 
 
The Panel comprised people of various backgrounds — single parents, advocates for low wage workers and more. This allowed us to learn about issues that we might not encounter otherwise, and exposed us to different ideas from people who are passionate about creating change in their work environments. 

Through the sessions, I realised the importance of seeing things from others’ perspectives before jumping into ‘problem solving mode’. 
 
I also learnt that when analysing solutions, it’s essential to envision the downstream impact, both implicit and explicit, so we can consider the trade-offs and refine our ideas based on what is practical and possible. 
 
There aren’t any simple solutions to promoting worklife harmony. Most solutions require support from different stakeholders and will take time to implement. 
 
This is why Singaporeans must stay educated on workplace issues, as it ensures that all stakeholders are equipped with the skills and knowledge to promote practices and norms that contribute to work-life harmony. 
 
The Citizens’ Panel on Work-Life Harmony is a unique initiative that provided citizens with resources to understand and deal with issues affecting us. 
 
We have been given autonomy in deciding which problems to address and what solutions to choose. Even details like the programme for each workgroup session and what was to be included in our reports were decided in collaboration with the Panel. 

All in all, this has been an empowering experience.
