“Being comfortable with extreme levels of uncertainty is key to success in the future.” 
 
In schools, we are often taught causal reasoning, where one plus one gives you a predictable and definitive answer. What I do is to enable youths to use effectual reasoning, where the outcome is a goal, and the journey is determined by them. 
 
As the co-founder of Reactor School, I hope to empower youths through Entrepreneurship 
Education programmes for those aged 13 to 24. We help them turn their ideas into projects, and those projects into companies. A start-up environment is rife with uncertainty, making it a good training ground for them to challenge themselves and build character. 
 
Being a part of the SG Youth Action Plan (YAP) began with volunteering for the National Youth Council’s 
Youth Expedition Programme when I was an undergraduate. Youth development has always been a passion, so I thought it was a great opportunity to get involved; especially when the government is actively trying to get our input. 
 
The SG YAP panel discussions are a safe space for youths, panel members and the government to cocreate a shared vision for 2025 with better policies and initiatives. This partnership is a step in the right direction. More people need to know that anyone can be an active citizen, and contribute ideas and actions towards building a better Singapore. 
 
We joke that complaining is a Singaporean pastime. Long queues, public transport being late, obsolete policies — nothing is spared. It’s easy to complain; it’s harder to do something about it. It’s important to hear someone else’s point of view, empathise, and jointly develop solutions by  respecting and engaging with each other even if you disagree. Change is a long and arduous process, but a better future makes it worth it. 
 
The next time you disagree with something, bring your opinion and an open mind. Let’s have a conversation about how Singapore can be better, and strive to achieve that together.
