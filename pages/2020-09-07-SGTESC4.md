As part of an ongoing series, the Singapore Together Emerging Stronger Conversation (ESC) on 15 August brought 40 Singaporeans together – each with unique experiences from the current crisis to share their concerns and views on how we can move onward together as one. 

Some of the points raised included increasing employment through global remote opportunities, addressing the apprehension of voluntary work, and getting more Singaporeans involved in creating policies. Most agreed that it takes all Singaporeans to come together, to propel Singapore towards greater heights. 

And many were inspired to see like-minded Singaporeans doing their part to achieve this common goal.

In cultivating resilience in times of crisis, **Padmini Venkataraman**, founder & CEO of Global Fin-Tech Connect, feels that finding innovative solutions and new ways to turn crisis into opportunities is essential. 

**Question:** What are you most encouraged by, amidst the current crisis? 

“Creativity. It’s really encouraging to see many out-of-the-box, creative solutions emerging side by side globally, to tap the needs of the crisis. 

An example is today’s session, where more people come together to solve problems for the society regardless of age, ethnic group, or professional background – the energy and motivation in supporting each other, is increased multiple fold. 

Human connections and energy brought to the table together to solve a problem – adds more enthusiasm, much more than worrying and trying to solve problems alone. 

Also listening to the struggles and concerns of others, gives many a feeling that we are in this together, and we need to help each other in a unified manner – the need to support each other will be enhanced if more Singaporeans would join such sessions.”

“Emerging stronger begins with you. Just keep going, be caring and resilient as a person,” says **Michelle Ow**, a facilitator-trainer-coach. 

**Question:** How do you think we can emerge from this crisis stronger? 

“On a personal level, be patient and kinder – to both yourself and others. 

And as a society, we should engage and appreciate those who walk the ground, and their voices. They might not be elected members of the cabinet, but they have the heart and soul for the people. 

I saw that in today’s session, how people have the courage to speak up and share their views and opinions. And I’m encouraged by that. 

Also, there’s much each generation has to learn from each other. And this crisis needs us to come together to inspire and motivate each other.”

Final-year undergraduate **Choo Yan Min** feels that maintaining peace, prosperity, and stability takes ‘me’ and ‘we’. “Do not be afraid to step up and help build that future you want to see,” he says. 

**Question:** What can we all do to become a more caring, cohesive and resilient society? 

“I think we need to have a mindset change. We need to see ourselves as active citizens who have the power to impact the lives of others. 

No impact is too small. I think sometimes what holds us back from helping others is the perception that what one individual can do is small, which is not true. 

For those who are already volunteering, we can start by simply reaching out to our friends and family, and encourage them to help out with volunteering so that they can see the good work we are doing and hopefully be inspired to do the same! 

After all, while it may be intuitive for one to put the bulk of the responsibility with regard to societal challenges on the government, I am of the opinion that everyone has a part to play in helping as well.”
