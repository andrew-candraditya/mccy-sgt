### Teaching SafeEntry through Zoom

*Stearic Tan, 71 years old*

“As part of #SmartNationTogether, Smart Nation taught seniors how to use Zoom at the beginning of CB. Stearic turned up late, but asked for dedicated “tuition” on how to host a Zoom meeting. We spent an additional 20mins to familiarize him. A few days later, he asked if he could be referenced to some material on SafeEntry and we directed him to the SafeEntry website. Two weeks later, we received a Zoom invite to attend a Zoom by Stearic! He had observed that fellow seniors in his Bukit Merah neighbourhood were having difficulties adjusting to SafeEntry (e.g. why was it needed, how to scan QR codes), and he conducted a 1.5hr lesson & Q&A out of his own initiative! 40 seniors attended, a very encouraging outcome for a first time!”

### SCOPE Live for a better Smart Nation Builder

*Mr Lim, 75 years old (member of NTUC U Live)*

“We were conducting a SCOPE Live session for the Smart Nation Builder (a truck that will rove around Singapore to collect feedback on digital government services) with 80 seniors from NTUC U Live (i.e. members >60). Seniors raised feedback that instructions on the screens were not clear (e.g. the word “next” was too small, instructions to “record” their feedback via speech was not intuitive).

Staff were at wits end, struggling to think of alternatives. Mr Lim stood quietly at the back with his coffee. Asking him if he had any suggestions, he shyly said in Hokkien-English– Why don’t just change the English words in the button to the “right arrow” emoticon and the word “record” to the “microphone” button? I am not a tech-expert but I can understand that.

It was brilliant. Everybody there agreed with him.”

### MOL (Active Ageing) Activity Finder

*Various Seniors, SCOPE at “Happy Go Lucky” Getai*

“When the MOL (AA) app was first conceived, the key feature was a digital MG card. MG seniors could now flash and enjoy MG perks and discounts on-the-go. Our engineers were keen to know if a drop down list of where to enjoy MG/PG specific perks would be useful, and therefore went to the ground to check via SCOPE.

At the Happy Go Lucky Getai event in late-Aug 2018, to our surprise, there was an overwhelming number of seniors that asked for the app to include an “activity finder”. We were initially reluctant, thinking such information would already be easily accessible at void-deck notice boards. Despite the significant engineering effort, we gave it a shot.

Today, the usage of the “Activity Finder” feature on the app is almost on par with the digital MG card.”

### Sharing “hacks” on how to do Digital better

*Mrs Chew, 67 years old (mum of a Smart Nation Ambassador)*

“When SafeEntry first started, my mum asked me for a step-by-step guide on using SE-QR. I downloaded a QR scanner for her Android, taught her how to unlock screen, open the QR scanner, scan the QR code, fill in the details and then check in. Even after teaching more than 5 times, she just could not get the hang of it. She gave up and said she would use SE-NRIC instead.

Two days later she called and scolded me for not suggesting a better way to SafeEntry. Her friend Doris, 70, at church had taught her how to put a SafeEntry widget as a shortcut on the lock-screen of her phone. She said it was so easy now. I was then forwarded a link from Shutterwhale, that was circulating in her seniors group Whatsapp chat, with a strong recommendation to try it myself.

Sometimes, seniors just know better =).”
