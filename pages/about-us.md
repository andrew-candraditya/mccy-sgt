![What is Singapore Together?](/images/about-us-header-1.jpg)

At the heart of the Singapore Together movement is the vision for Singaporeans to partner with the government, and with one another, to own, shape and act on our shared future together.

Launched by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in June 2019, the movement aims to open up many more partnership opportunities for Singaporeans to participate in, and provide support for more citizen-led initiatives.

Whatever our backgrounds or interests, we can contribute in areas that  we care about. Let's harness our talents, turn diversity into strengths, overcome challenges and be a strong nation that present and future generations will be proud of.
