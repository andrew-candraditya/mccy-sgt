As we reach a critical point in the battle against COVID-19, it is important for us as Singaporeans to play our part in the fight. Each of us will need to take individual and collective precautions to help safeguard one another and save lives. As part of the “circuit breaker” measures put in place, all of us are strongly encouraged to stay at home; but this does not mean that we cannot stay active and engaged. 

Singapore can pull through this only if we do it together! [Click here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e3b868988573300116ca38a) if you would like to contribute an idea or an intiative to help others. Thank you for stepping forward. 

#SingaporeTogether  #SGUnited   #StayHomeForSG
