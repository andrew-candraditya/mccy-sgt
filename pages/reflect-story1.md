"During home-based learning, I had to teach from my own bedroom... as much as I felt vulnerable, my students must have felt the same way. This is a good experience for empathy-building and growing a shared experience. 

I hope that no child should feel ashamed of his/her room or house. 

One thing I hope to do is: opening up conversations about social inequality, social mobility and empowering my students to come on board with me to be champions of change through our community projects."
