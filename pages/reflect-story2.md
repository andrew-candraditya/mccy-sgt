"I realised that in the midst of the trying times, many of us do try to extend a helping hand, while looking out for each other. It makes me learn the impact one can make, even by a small simple gesture of checking up on others, of standing in solidarity with those in need by donating, all these can make a huge impact on how strong we can stand as a community.Â  

One thing I hope to do is: Having tough, difficult conversations with friends and family to discuss how we can help the vulnerable, using that as a platform to encourage others to donate, to volunteer, can eventually send out shockwaves, that incentivize everyone to help each other out and leave a lasting impact."
