## How has COVID-19 affected you?

COVID-19 has changed the way we live, work, play, and communicate. We welcome you to come forward to share their experiences and what they learned during this time of reflection. Some of our lives were forever changed by the kindness of strangers. Frontliners who went beyond their duty. Ordinary people who took extraordinary steps to help the community. We want to hear all your stories, and share them with others, to inspire and encourage them in these trying times.
