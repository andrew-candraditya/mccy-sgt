![How has COVID-19 affected you?](https://via.placeholder.com/700x300.png)

COVID-19 has changed the way we live, work, play, and communicate. Singaporeans have come forward to share their experiences and what they learned during this time of reflection. Some of their lives were forever changed by the kindness of strangers. Frontliners who went beyond their duty. Ordinary people who took extraordinary steps to help the community. We have heard their stories, and we want to listen to yours too.
