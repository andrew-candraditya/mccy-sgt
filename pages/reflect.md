![How has COVID-19 affected you?](/images/reflect-header-1.jpg)

COVID-19 has changed the way we live, work, play, and communicate. Some of our lives have been touched by the kindness of strangers. Frontliners who went beyond their duty. Ordinary people who took extraordinary steps to help the community. 

We welcome you to share your experiences and what you learned during this time of reflection. Share your stories with others, to inspire and encourage each other in these trying times.
