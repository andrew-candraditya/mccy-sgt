### Ministry of Home Affairs' Emerging Stronger Conversations x Yellow Ribbon SG - Beyond Second Chances on 29 Sep 2020

Covid-19 has changed the norms and brought about many challenges to our nation. There are many amongst us whose lives have been affected by this pandemic, and the ex-offenders are not spared from this. By supporting and encouraging the vulnerable in our midst, we will emerge stronger to become a more caring, cohesive and resilient society. The Emerging Stronger Conversations organised by Yellow Ribbon Singapore seeks to initiate conversations on the likely threats and opportunities when we reintegrate an ex-offender back into our fold. Embracing the ex-offenders back into our neighborhood and workplace are necessary steps to take in building a more inclusive and cohesive society.
